        PromID can be run from the command line:
        ```sh
        promid -I hg19.fa -O hg19_promoters.bed
        ```
        Required parameters:
         - ```-I```: Input fasta file.
         - ```-O```: Output bed file.
        
        Optional parameters:
         - ```-D```: Minimum soft distance between the predicted TSS, defaults to 1000.
         - ```-C```: Comma separated list of chromosomes to use for promoter prediction, defaults to all.
         - ```-T1```: Decision threshold for the scan model, defaults to 0.2.
         - ```-T2```: Decision threshold for the prediction model, defaults to 0.5.
